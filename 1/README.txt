Question2:
- For the mean image, the plot have a rough shape of 0.
- For the top-20 eigenvectors, these plot is more clear when it's related eigenvalue is larger.
- For the top-100 eigenvalues, the top-4 eigenvalues is obviously higher than others, and appropriately top-1 is double of top-2, top-2 is double of top-3 etc.

Question3:
-
