Question2:
- For the mean image, the plot have a rough shape of digit 0.
- For the top-20 eigenvectors, these plot is more clear when it's related eigenvalue is larger. The Top 1 eigenvector have the clearest shape of digit 0.
- For the top-100 eigenvalues, the first 4 eigenvalues is obviously higher than others, and appropriately top-1 is double of top-2, top-2 is double of top-3 etc. The top 20 eigenvalues is higher than the other eigenvalues.

Question3:
- For the mean image, the plot have a rough shape of digit 2.
- For the top-20 eigenvectors, these plot is more clear when it's related eigenvalue is larger. The Top 1 eigenvector have the clearest shape of digit 2.
- For the top-100 eigenvalues, the first 8 eigenvalues is obviously higher than others, and appropriately top-1 is double of top-2, top-2 is double of top-3 etc. The top 10 eigenvalues is higher than the other eigenvalues.

Question4:
- For the mean image, the plot is much more like the digit 0.
- For the top-20 eigenvectors, the first image is more like digit 0, for the other images, for example, the top 2-10 images, both have the shape of digit 0 and 2.
- For the top-100 eigenvalues, the first 4 eigenvalues is obviously higher than others.
